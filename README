OVERVIEW
========

This is a BrainFuck intrpreter. It is very simple, but more features are
expected. This uses a doubly linked list as tape, and the data in the cells are
the size of char in your system (typically 8 bits on x86 platforms).

Along with gbrainfuck.c I put some example BrainFuck code. My pet one is
mandelbrot.bf, by Erik Bosman, a mandelbrot fractal viewer. There is also a
BrainFuck interpreter in BrainFuck, an ASCII table generator and other things.
Enjoy!



USAGE
=====

./gbf -f <file>
./gbf 

If <file> was specified on the command line, the interpreter will treat it as a
BrainFuck source file; otherwise, it will read from stdin until a EOF
(control-d on most Unix systems) is found. Any character that is not a
BrainFuck keyword is considered to be comment, and is ignored.
